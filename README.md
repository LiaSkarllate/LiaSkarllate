## Greetings and welcome to my profile!

### About me

I am William Fernandes Dorante, a Computer Science graduate from Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), in Rio Claro, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

I have over 5 years of experience in Java backend development, both with and without frameworks (Spring), along with a broad understanding of the full development cycle, working daily with database manipulation (SQL), deployment (Docker and Kubernetes), frontend development (React) and cloud services (AWS) to ensure systems operation I work on.

My work focuses on finding efficient solutions to daily challenges and applying software engineering best practices in the Java ecosystem to create value for those impacted by my work. Besides, I strive to balance code quality and delivery time, ensuring that solutions are both well-built and delivered within deadlines.

Finally, I am experienced in teamwork with agile methodologies, but I can also be highly productive working independently.
