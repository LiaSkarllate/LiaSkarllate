## Greetings and welcome to my profile!

I hope you are doing well.

### About me

I am William Fernandes Dorante, a Computer Science graduate from Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), in Rio Claro, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I have over 5 years of experience in Java backend development, along with a broad understanding of the full development cycle, working with database management, deployment, frontend development and cloud services.

My work focuses on finding efficient solutions to daily challenges and applying software engineering best practices in the Java ecosystem to create value for those impacted by my work. Besides, I strive to balance code quality and delivery time, ensuring that solutions are both well-built and delivered within deadlines.

Finally, I am experienced in teamwork with agile methodologies, but I can also be highly productive working independently.
