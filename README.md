### About me

My name is William Fernandes Dorante. I graduated from Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) in Rio Claro/SP with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have been working with Java for over 4 years and currently work as a Java Developer at Autbank in SÃ£o Paulo/SP, a company specialized in IT solutions for the financial market.

My work is driven by the search for the best solutions to everyday challenges and by the application of best practices in the Java Platform to create value for the people impacted by my work.
